            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>
              Hardness of factoring is a mathematical concept that is based on the fact that classical computers are not efficient in factoring numbers that are the products of large prime numbers. At its core, this concept is based on integer factorization, where a number is worked into a product of smaller integers. We can take this a step further and restrict the search to only prime factors as well, making it even more difficult for adversaries to break in without the key. Something to consider here is that not all numbers, even of equal lengths, require the same amount of computation to factor. That is why we use semiprimes, which are the products of two prime numbers and the most difficult, currently known version of this problem. The famous RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) public key cryptosystem is based on the cryptographic concept of hardness of factoring.
            </p>
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <p>
              Typical implementations of the Hardness of Factoring concept (RSA) are used for smaller key lengths. That is why RSA is so commonly used to communicate shared keys for symmetric-key schemes. If you’re not concerned about quantum attacks, then Hardness of Factoring could be the choice for you. Use this if you don’t want to work in polynomial time. Hardness of factoring can produce some very powerful results; in 2019, a team of researchers determined that in order to break a 1024-bit RSA modulus, a machine with 500 times the strength of a computer with 900 core-years of computing power would be needed. Hardness of factoring is definitely a cryptographic tool you want in your toolbelt when dealing with digital signatures.
            </p>
            <h3>Why others would not work</h3>
            <p>
              Other mathematical processes can be solved or dealt with in polynomial time whereas the hardness of factorization (integer factorization) has no known algorithm that can factor all integers in polynomial time. RSA is also one of the most well known, oldest, implementations of the hardness of factoring concepts. Thus, it has had the most research and stress tests done to it, proving its reliability, which other algorithms do not have to boast.
