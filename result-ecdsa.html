            <h3>Explanation</h3>
            <p>
              The elliptic curve is a mathematical concept that can be used to help implement secure public key cryptographic systems. This discipline that uses elliptic curves to help create cryptographic schemes is known as Elliptic-curve cryptography. Elliptic-curve cryptography works off of the structure that elliptic curves create over finite fields. Elliptic-curve cryptography’s security is based on the difficulty of computing point multiplication when not given product and original points, making it difficult for adversaries and trivial for the proper users. It has been researched and determined that elliptic curves have many different uses in the cryptography space, including being used as: digital signature algorithms, key agreement, and as PRNGs.
            </p>
            <h3>Pros</h3>
            <p>
              Elliptic-curve cryptography allows for smaller key sizes. ECC also has many uses, not only as a digital signature algorithm but also has applications in PRNGs and key agreement. ECC is so well trusted and considered a staple of cryptographic security that the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has recommended its use and has placed it in their 'Suite B' of recommended secure algorithms.
            </p>
            <h3>Why others wouldn’t work</h3>
            <p>
              Other cryptographic concepts may not be considered as secure or have the same backing as ECC does. Elliptic curve cryptography can provide just as good security as systems like RSA but with fewer bits. Elliptic curve implementions typically require less computational resources such as power usage and chip size. Also, other concepts do not have the same versatility that elliptic curves provide. There are several schemes built a top of elliptic curves, which include, but are not limited to:
